# Wu-Hu-Simulation
Configuration files for MPB and MEEP reproducing a simulation by Wu and Hu.

This contains scheme configurations for MPB calculating band diagrams for the setup proposed by Wu and Hu, called wuhu.ctl, and a modified setup, called square.ctl.
Furthermore there are configurations for MEEP simulating light shining on these structures, for both setups, called wuhuedge.ctl and squareedge.ctl.
Finally, there are some animations of the z-component of the electrical field from the MEEP simulations.
